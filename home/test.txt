CAIRO -- CAIRO-Egypt's new military rulers said Sunday that they would dissolve parliament, suspend the constitution and hold elections for a civilian government in as soon as six months, addressing some of the demands of the protesters who ousted President Hosni Mubarak.
As Cairo returned to its daily routines on the first working day since the revolution, the announcement set a short timetable to organize elections while allaying fears about open-ended military rule. The military took power upon Mubarak's resignation Friday.
The decision by the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces not to form an interim civilian government and to rule by decree in the meantime, however, left questions. Among them: What role will civilians play in the transition, and who will be on the committee to draft changes to the constitution?
Meanwhile, Israeli officials said they're unruffled by the regime change in their neighbor and leading Arab ally. A day after the Egyptian army said it would honor all international treaties - an apparent nod to its 1979 peace accord with Israel - Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak said Sunday that the nations would maintain a strong relationship.
